			Welcome to my site!  I will mostly just use this as a place to put stuff I've worked on, done, or anything else that I want you to be able to see.

			<h3 class="center">About me:</h3>
			<p>I'm a 27yo girl from KY who enjoys lifting, games, and traveling.  I primarily focus on IIDX and STG/東方 when it comes to games, though I'm more occupied with RL stuff these days.  I adore physically strong girls, genderweird girls, princely girls, magical girls, any kind of strong girl; you name it.  I want to achieve a future where every girl feels free to become strong and badass.  I'm also interested in lifting and becoming strong myself!  I can probably princess carry you. </p>
			<p>I am queer, ND, and even though I'm kind of anxious, I want to be friendly to most people.  I am not friendly towards poly people or people who desire to regulate fiction and the ways people can experience attraction within the bounds of fiction.  Please respect my views on these matters.</p>
			<p>Please feel free to message me if you want to talk and be friends!</p>
