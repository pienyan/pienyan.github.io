			<br />
			Welcome to my site!<br />
			I will mostly just use this as a place to put stuff I've worked on, done, or<br />
			anything else that I want you to be able to see.<br />
			
			<h3>About me:</h3>
			I'm a 27yo girl from KY who enjoys lifting, games, and traveling.<br />
			I adore physically strong girls, genderweird girls, princely girls, magical girls, any kind of strong girl; you name it. I'm also interested in lifting and becoming strong myself! I can probably princess carry you.</br>
			I primarily focus on IIDX and STG/東方, but I'm more occupied with RL stuff these days.<br />
			I want to achieve a future where every girl feels free to become strong and badass.<br />
			Please feel free to message me if you want to talk and be friends!<br />
